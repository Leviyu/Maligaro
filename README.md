# Maligaro


---

*Maligaro* is my own code repository, mostly wrote for my research work through my Ph.D.. Most of the code in this repository are related to time-series signal processing, with many specific algorithms that I have designed and optimized during the years. 

It is maintained by C and C++, at the end of my second year, I transferred my language preference from C to C++ cause of the convenience of Class. 

This repository also contains the core code for the three projects in my thesis:
- Empirical Wavelet Method
- Virtual Station Stacking
- Forward Tomography

The three projects share many basic data structures and methods but each of the them have their separate directory, where Make file can be found. 

This repository has recorded my pain and sorrow, my excitement and passion, my long-nights and earlier mornings, every time I open it, I know it is going to be an eventful day.
